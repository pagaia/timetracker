# TimeTracker

Working every day on several tasks at work I needed something to take the time for each task.
The Tempo provided with Jira was not simple to use it since I should have several open tabs and switch among them to stop/start the timing.
So with this simple Time Tracker I can have all the tasks on the same page and start/stop that one I need to work on.

## TODO

* fix the task name change, setting the name of the task as value into the field, adding the calcel button
* add a possibility to change manually the time
